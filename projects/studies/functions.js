/**
 * FUNCTIONS:
 * 0. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
 * 1.  It can take in inputs, known as parameters, and 
 * return a single output, known as a return value.
 * 2. Functions allow us to reuse code and make our programs more organized and efficient.
 */

// 1. The Two Phases to Using Functions
/**
 * First, we must define the function. 
 * This involves specifying the task the function will perform and 
 * any necessary parameters.
 * 
 * 
 * Next, we can execute or call the function by using its name 
 * followed by parentheses, including any necessary arguments.
 */
// code example 
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
        
    greet("John"); // logs "Hello, John!"
    
    // 2. What's the difference between a function's parameters and arguments passed to a function?
    /**
     * The parameters of a function are the variables specified in the function definition. 
     * These act as placeholders for the actual values, known as arguments, 
     * that will be passed to the function when it is called.
     */
    // code example 
    function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
        
    greet("John"); // the parameter is "name" and the argument is "John"
    
    // 3. What's the syntax for a named function?
    /**
     * A named function is a function with a specific name, which is used to call the function. 
     * The syntax for a named function is:
     */
    function functionName(parameters) {
        // function code
        }
    
    // code example 
    function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
    
    // 4. How we assign a function to a variable?
    /**
     * We can assign a function to a variable by using the assignment operator (=). 
     * This is known as a function expression.
     */
    // code example
    let greet = function(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
        
    greet("John"); // logs "Hello, John!"
    
    // 5. How do we specify inputs and outputs?
    /**
     * To specify inputs, or parameters, we list them within the parentheses in the function definition. 
     * To specify an output, or return value, we use the return statement within the function code.
     */
    // code example
    function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
    }
        
    console.log(add(2, 3)); // logs 5
    
    // 6. Scope
    /**
     * Scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within a program. 
     * Functions can see and modify variables in the global or parent scopes, but the inverse is not true. 
     * Variables defined within a function are only accessible within that function.
     */
    // code example
    let x = "global";
    
    function testScope() {
    let x = "local";
    console.log(x); // logs "local"
    }
    
    testScope();
    console.log(x); // logs "global"
    
    // 7. Closures
    /**
     * A closure is a function that has access to the variables in its parent scope, 
     * even after the parent function has finished executing. 
     * If an object returned from the function is held in memory somewhere (referenced), 
     * that closure stays alive and the data can continue to exist within it.
     */
    // code example
    function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
    }
    }
    const counter = createCounter();
    console.log(counter()); // 1
